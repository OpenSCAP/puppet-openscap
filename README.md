# OpenSCAP Puppet Module

This project has been superseded by the [Foreman SCAP Client Puppet Module](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-foreman_scap_client).
This project is therefore deprecated, and it is kept here just for historical reference.

> OpenSCAP Puppet Module exposes OpenSCAP primitives to puppet DSL.
> 
> ## Class: openscap::xccdf::eval
> 
> This class ensures that client system is evaluated against given XCCDF guidance.
> The class supports reoccuring scans. The results are stored at the client system.
> 
> ### Parameters:
> 
>  * $xccdf_path: Path to XCCDF or DataStream file
>  * $xccdf_profile: XCCDF Profile to evaluate
>  * $period: How often the evaluation shall happen
>  * $weekday: Preferable weekday for evaluation to happen
>  * $content_package: Package which includes $xccdf_path
>  * $scan_name: The identifier of the reoccuring scan on the disk
> 
> Default arguments will evaluate SCAP-Security-Guide policy in a weekly manner.
> 
> ### Sample Usage
> 
> The following example ensures that every week an SCAP audit is executed and the results
> are stored under /var/lib/openscap directory. The openscap::xccdf::eval class ensures that
> the very last audit result is present. I.e. if puppet is not run on Friday, the audit will
> be executed within the next puppet run. The example will automatically attempt to install
> ruby-openscap and scap-security-guide on the system.
> 
> ```
> class { openscap::xccdf::eval:
>   name => my-weekly-ssg-audit,
>   weekday => Friday,
>   period => weekly,
> }
> ```
> 
> ## Class: openscap::xccdf::foreman_audit
> 
> This class is very same as openscap::xccdf::eval. The only difference is that
> this one attempts to upload audit results to Foreman's smart-proxy.
> 
> ### Parameters:
> 
> foreman_audit takes the same parameters as openscap::xccdf::eval, plus:
> 
>  * foreman_proxy: The URI of Foremen's Smart Proxy to receive the audit result
> 
> By default (without the foreman_proxy argument) foreman_audit assumes that proxy
> is hosted on the same system as the puppetmaster.
